| Orphan components and functions | 0 in 1414 components and functions | 100.0% | 4 | 10% of components and functions |
| Long member chain lines | 0 in 21.98 thousand lines | 100.0% | 4 | 30 per thousand lines |
| Deeply indented lines | 0 in 21.98 thousand lines | 100.0% | 4 | 30 per thousand lines |

| **Design pattern file count** | | **100.0%** | **10** | |
| Files the patterns predict but are missing | 0 in 4 predicted files | 100.0% | 10 | 50% of predicted files |
| Entities outside their expected file count | not measured | not measured | — | 50% of entities |
| **Prose** | | **100.0%** | **20** | |
| Conditions with calls tangled inside calls | 0 in 333 branches | 100.0% | 8 | 25% of branches |
| Conditions compared to a raw literal | 0 in 333 branches | 100.0% | 6 | 25% of branches |
| Accessor names that want to be a property | 0 in 1414 functions | 100.0% | 6 | 10% of functions |
| **Widget adoption** | | **not measured** | **0** | |
| Markup written by hand where a widget should be | not measured | not measured | — | 50% of widget slots |
| **Input validation** | | **not measured** | **0** | |
| Doors that write without checking their input against the columns | not measured | not measured | — | 50% of write doors |

Each element scores 100% with no offenders and falls in a straight line to 0% when its offenders, measured against the size of the codebase, reach the figure in the last column. The score is the weighted average of the elements that could be measured; an element that could not be measured lends its weight to the rest. Weights and zero points are set in `tools/refactor/rules.json` under `score.elements`. The offenders behind every reading are in `tools/refactor/audit-output/audit.json`.
